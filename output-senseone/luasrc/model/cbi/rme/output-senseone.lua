    From their website:
    <blockquote>
<p>At SenseOne, our vision is to deliver IoT solutions that exceed customerâ€™s expectations.

<p>We came to work on the Internet of Things from on the ground challenges to connect assets and systems inside commercial and industrial buildings.

<p>From a business standpoint, we have created an IoT middleware platform that is capable of reducing the lifecycle cost and effort of multiple integrations that are central to any IoT implementation.

<p>From a technical standpoint, we have focused on interoperability requirements and developed a scalable IoT middleware layer for integrating heterogeneous systems and enabling connected environments.
